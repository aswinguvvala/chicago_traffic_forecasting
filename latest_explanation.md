## Feature Engineering (19 Features)

Your model processes exactly **19 carefully engineered features** that capture the essential patterns for demand forecasting:

### 1. Temporal Features (8 features)
These capture time-based patterns crucial for transportation demand:

| Feature | Description | Example Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| `hour` | Hour of day (0-23) | 8.0 | Peak hours identification |
| `day_of_week` | Day of week (0-6) | 0 (Monday) | Weekly patterns |
| `month` | Month (1-12) | 1 (January) | Seasonal patterns |
| `is_weekend` | Weekend flag (0/1) | 0.0 | Weekend vs weekday |
| `is_rush_hour` | Rush hour flag (0/1) | 1.0 | Peak demand periods |
| `is_business_hours` | Business hours flag (0/1) | 0.0 | Working hours |
| `hour_sin` | Cyclical hour encoding | 0.8660 | Smooth hour transitions |
| `hour_cos` | Cyclical hour encoding | -0.5000 | 24-hour cyclical pattern |

- Rush Hours: 7-9 AM and 5-7 PM 
- Business Hours: 9 AM - 5 PM 
- Cyclical Encoding: Prevents artificial boundaries (23h → 0h discontinuity)

### 2. Spatial Features (4 features)
These capture location-based demand patterns:

| Feature | Description | Example Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| `pickup_lat` | Latitude coordinate | 41.8781 | Exact location |
| `pickup_lon` | Longitude coordinate | -87.6298 | Exact location |
| `distance_from_center` | Distance from Loop | 0.0000 | Urban vs suburban |
| `is_downtown` | Downtown flag (<0.05 distance) | 1.0 | High-demand area |

- Chicago Loop Center: (41.8781, -87.6298) 
- Downtown Threshold: <0.05 degrees (~3.5 miles) 
- Geographic Bounds: 41.6-42.0°N, -87.9 to -87.5°W

### 3. Historical Features (3 features) - CRITICAL
These are the most important features for real forecasting, using past demand to predict future:

| Feature | Description | Example Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| `demand_lag_1` | Demand 1 period ago (3h) | 25.4469 | Recent trend |
| `demand_lag_8` | Demand 24 hours ago | 24.9801 | Daily patterns |
| `demand_ma_3` | 3-period moving average | 25.0523 | Smoothed trend |

- Time Window: 3-hour aggregation periods 
- Lag Calculation: Based on Chicago transportation patterns 
- Realistic Estimation: Uses hour/location/day patterns for historical approximation

### 4. Weather Features (1 feature)
Weather impact on transportation demand:

| Feature | Description | Example Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| `weather_temp` | Temperature (°F) | 32.0 | Weather impact |

### 5. Trip Characteristics (3 features)
Average trip patterns for demand context:

| Feature | Description | Example Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| `trip_miles` | Average trip distance | 3.2 | Trip length context |
| `trip_duration_minutes` | Average trip time | 18.5 | Duration context |
| `fare` | Average fare | 14.75 | Economic context |

## How Prediction Works

### 1. Data Flow Pipeline
```
User Input → Feature Engineering → Feature Scaling → Model Inference → Business Logic → Final Prediction
```

### 2. Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Input Collection
- - Location: Latitude/longitude coordinates
- - Time: Timestamp for prediction
- - Weather: Current conditions and temperature
- - Context: Optional special events

#### Step 2: Feature Engineering
```python
# Example for Downtown Chicago, Monday 8 AM
features = [
 8.0, # hour: 8 AM
 0.0, # day_of_week: Monday
 1.0, # month: January
 0.0, # is_weekend: No
 1.0, # is_rush_hour: Yes (7-9 AM)
 0.0, # is_business_hours: No (before 9 AM)
 0.8660, # hour_sin: sin(2π×8/24)
 -0.5000, # hour_cos: cos(2π×8/24)
 41.8781, # pickup_lat: Chicago Loop
 -87.6298, # pickup_lon: Chicago Loop
 0.0000, # distance_from_center: Downtown
 1.0, # is_downtown: Yes
 25.45, # demand_lag_1: Previous 3h demand
 24.98, # demand_lag_8: 24h ago demand
 25.05, # demand_ma_3: 3-period average
 32.0, # weather_temp: 32°F
 3.2, # trip_miles: Average Chicago trip
 18.5, # trip_duration_minutes: Average time
 14.75 # fare: Average Chicago fare
]
```

#### Step 3: Feature Scaling
- - StandardScaler: Mean=0, Std=1 normalization
- - Trained on 10K samples: Realistic Chicago data distribution
- - Prevents feature dominance: Lat/lon vs binary flags

#### Step 4: Model Inference
```python
# Forward pass through neural network
input_tensor = torch.FloatTensor([scaled_features])

# 1. Input projection: 19 → 256 features
projected = model.input_projection(input_tensor)

# 2. Bidirectional LSTM: 256 → 512 features
lstm_output, _ = model.lstm(projected)

# 3. Attention mechanism: Focus on relevant patterns
attention_output, _ = model.attention(lstm_output, lstm_output, lstm_output)

# 4. Combine with residual connection
combined = lstm_output + attention_output

# 5. Output layers: 512 → 256 → 128 → 1
final_output = model.output_layers(combined)

# 6. ReLU ensures non-negative demand
prediction = max(0, final_output.item())
```

#### Step 5: Business Logic Application
```python
# Raw model output: e.g., 13.32 rides per 3-hour window
raw_prediction = 13.32

# Round to integer demand
predicted_demand = 13 # rides per 3-hour window

# Calculate business metrics
confidence = 0.80 # Based on model performance
surge_multiplier = 1.65 # Based on demand level
wait_time = 5 # minutes (inverse relationship)
revenue_potential = 13 × 14.75 × 1.65 = $316.19
```
