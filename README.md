## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aswinguvvala/chicago_traffic_forecasting.git
cd chicago_traffic_forecasting
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn torch plotly
```

3. **Train the models** (required for first run)
```bash
python models/ml_trainer.py
```

4. **Run the application**
```bash
streamlit run chicago_ml_demand_predictor.py
```

5. **Open in browser**: http://localhost:8501

## 🎨 Interface

The app features a clean, modern design with:
- **Theme Toggle**: Click 🌓 in the top-right corner
- **Inline Controls**: Model selection, Chicago location, and weather in one row
- **Clean Results**: Large prediction number with confidence and model info
- **Responsive**: Works perfectly on mobile and desktop

## 🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline

### Models
- **RandomForest**: 79.3% accuracy, robust and reliable
- **LSTM Neural Network**: 62.4% accuracy, deep learning approach

### Features
- **45 Engineered Features**: Temporal, spatial, and contextual
- **Dynamic Weather Impact**: Real-time weather condition effects
- **Location Intelligence**: Chicago neighborhood-specific patterns
- **Time Series**: Lag features and moving averages

### Training Data
- **120,000+ Records**: Real Chicago transportation patterns
- **6 Chicago Locations**: Loop, O'Hare, Lincoln Park, etc.
- **Weather Conditions**: Clear, cloudy, rain, snow, fog
- **Time Patterns**: Rush hour, weekend, seasonal effects

## 📊 Predictions

The app predicts:
- **Rides per Hour**: Main demand forecast
- **Confidence Level**: ML model confidence (75-95%)
- **Model Used**: RandomForest or LSTM selection

## 🎯 Usage

1. **Select Model**: Choose RandomForest (recommended) or LSTM
2. **Pick Location**: Select from 6 Chicago areas (Loop, O'Hare, etc.)
3. **Set Weather**: Choose current weather condition
4. **Get Prediction**: Click "Get Prediction" for instant ML forecast

## 🌃 Chicago Locations

- **Loop**: Financial district, highest weekday demand
- **O'Hare**: Airport with consistent patterns
- **Magnificent Mile**: Shopping district with tourist activity
- **Lincoln Park**: Residential area with weekend entertainment
- **Wicker Park**: Nightlife destination with evening peaks
- **Navy Pier**: Tourist attraction with seasonal patterns

## 🔧 Development

### Local Model Training
```bash
# Train both RandomForest and LSTM models
python models/ml_trainer.py

# This creates models/saved_models/ directory with:
# - random_forest_model.pkl
# - lstm_model.pt
# - feature_pipeline.pkl
# - model_metrics.pkl
```

### Customization
- **Theme Colors**: Edit CSS variables in the Streamlit app
- **Chicago Locations**: Add more locations in the `chicago_locations` dict
- **Weather Types**: Extend weather conditions in the selectbox
- **Model Parameters**: Adjust in `models/ml_trainer.py`

## 📈 Performance

- **File Size**: 356 lines (53% reduction from original)
- **Load Time**: <2 seconds on modern devices  
- **Prediction Speed**: ~100ms per forecast
- **Memory Usage**: <50MB typical usage

## 🎨 Themes

**Light Theme**: Clean whites and grays for daytime use
**Dark Theme**: Comfortable dark grays for nighttime use
**System**: Automatically matches your OS preference
